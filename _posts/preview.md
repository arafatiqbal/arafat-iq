Here are some of my favorite apps on the Mac that make my life as a developer easier.

Let's get started

## **1. Rectangle**

Mac window management is trash. This helps you organize your windows on your desktop. There are paid versions of this exact app like magnet, but why would you want to pay...

[Install Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/)

## **2. Gifox**

Do you ever need to show something to someone, but screen recording is too much and a screenshot wouldn't show everything? Why not send a gif instead!

[Install Gifox](https://gifox.app/)

## **3. Notion**

Notion has to be one of the best note apps. There are things I don't like about it, but for the most part, it does what you tell it to, and your notes stay oragnized.

[Install Notion](https://www.notion.so/)

## **4. iTerm2**

The default terminal for mac is okay. It will get the job done. iTerm2 gives you a few more customizations + features.

[Install iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/)

## **5. Boop**

If you work with a lot of text often, Boop will help you modify it based on pre-existing scripts. For example, you have a super messy unformated json file. Paste it into boop, and run the format json script! Done!
[Install Boop](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/boop/id1518425043?mt=12)
